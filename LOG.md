# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 14 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started up Github, forked our the official repo and wrote up a plan for the 100 day challenge. Downloaded XCode for future app design for a database/profesional hours log app I'd like to build for my current work industry.

Going thorugh my backlog and bookmarks of things I want to do including:
- CSS Canvas and Grid, responsive design;
- Building a contact form with just JS;
- App development;
- Page transitions;
- Javascript and jQuery (particlarly transition effects);
- Build 1 page About Me site;
- PHP/SQL (Probably on 2R challenge)

**Thoughts:** Starting is always the hardest but using a stopwatch to do 2 x 30min stints to stay on track with getting a full hour per day. Baby is due next week so it'll be interesting. 

**Link to work:** No Code yet :(


### Day 1: 15 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building the Hello World App with an Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ios-9-developer-course/learn/v4/overview. Learning the Xcode interface, took my old Macbook Pro considerable time to load everything. But project ready tofor editing.  Also tried to learn to quote code snippets in HTML without PHP coding... No such luck. Remembered to re-build my wordpress site and learn building without code that is not from scratch. Will update the site tomrrow  and link to the log.

**Thoughts:** Need a basic refresher in HTML and CSS tags, will have to do that on the commute to work. Thiking about HTML/CSS canvas project as well.
