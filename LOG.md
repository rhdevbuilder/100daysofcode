# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 14 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started up Github, forked our the official repo and wrote up a plan for the 100 day challenge. Downloaded XCode for future app design for a database/profesional hours log app I'd like to build for my current work industry.

Going thorugh my backlog and bookmarks of things I want to do including:
- CSS Canvas and Grid, responsive design;
- Building a contact form with just JS;
- App development;
- Page transitions;
- Javascript and jQuery (particlarly transition effects);
- Build 1 page About Me site;
- PHP/SQL (Probably on 2R challenge)

**Thoughts:** Starting is always the hardest but using a stopwatch to do 2 x 30min stints to stay on track with getting a full hour per day. Baby is due next week so it'll be interesting. 

**Link to work:** No Code yet :(
