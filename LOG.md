# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 14 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started up Github, forked our the official repo and wrote up a plan for the 100 day challenge. Downloaded XCode for future app design for a database/profesional hours log app I'd like to build for my current work industry.

Going thorugh my backlog and bookmarks of things I want to do including:
- CSS Canvas and Grid, responsive design;
- Building a contact form with just JS;
- App development;
- Page transitions;
- Javascript and jQuery (particlarly transition effects);
- Build 1 page About Me site;
- PHP/SQL (Probably on 2R challenge)

**Thoughts:** Starting is always the hardest but using a stopwatch to do 2 x 30min stints to stay on track with getting a full hour per day. Baby is due next week so it'll be interesting.

### Day 1: 15 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building the Hello World App with an Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ios-9-developer-course/learn/v4/overview. Learning the Xcode interface, took my old Macbook Pro considerable time to load everything. But project ready tofor editing.  Also tried to learn to quote code snippets in HTML without PHP coding... No such luck. Remembered to re-build my wordpress site and learn building without code that is not from scratch. Will update the site tomrrow  and link to the log.

**Thoughts:** Need a basic refresher in HTML and CSS tags, will have to do that on the commute to work. Thiking about HTML/CSS canvas project as well.

**Link to work:** No Code yet :(

### Day 2: 11 February 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back from the baby hiatus! Trying to get an hour in each day despite not sleeping or exercising. Today thought of a jQuery exercise for a smooth scroll between divs, using a Mirrors edge-inspired color scheme. Just finished Mirrors Edge Catalyst on Xbox One and wanted to use the same color scheme. 
**Thoughts**: Good to finish a quick exercise, probably took more than 1hr but satisfied with result. Changed from Javascript to jQuery for convenience, but still need to build up Javascript knowledge.

### Day 3: 12 February 2018

**Today's Progress**: Looking to try a project in Three.js after coming across "the Aviator" (https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/). Codrops is a beautiful website with awesome tutorials! Interesting language syntax but would love to be able to create 3D animations purely from code. 
**Thoughts:** Despite having an automatic debugger in jsfiddle, I can't even make the cube appear! Although I am so very tired...

### Day 4: 21 February 2018

**Today's Progress**: Many days have progressed and whilst I haven't updated anything in the log, I have been studying and taking notes, checking tutorials but nothing concrete. Having a baby certainly hasn't made it easy to study.
**Thoughts:** Instead of chasing a variety of coding disciplines I found it best to focus on only 1 or 2 disciplines at once before moving onto the next. The focus will be finishing the CSS Grid exercises and completing a basic js/jQuery course: https://www.udemy.com/javascript-and-jquery-basics-for-beginners/learn
**Link to work:** Nil for now.


### Day 5: 22 February 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through JS course on Codeacademy. As its been so long since I last worked with JS, I reset the progress and started from scratch.   
**Thoughts:** JS courses are hard to learn by only teaching individual items with no context or syntax. I swear I'm going to make an Udemy course one day to teach beginner JS...
**Link to work:** No code today.

### Day 6: 23 February 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continued JS course
**Thoughts:** Also looking at JS course on Udemy at the same time, but while the Codeacademy course has no syntax, this Udemy course has no structure or blocks to build upon, no natural progression.
**Link to work:** No Code today.


### Day 7: 24 February 2018
**Today's Progress**: Working through CSS and CSS Grid, including making a responsive CSS Grid. I can see myself using this often in future works. Its a very easy model with easy flexibility.
**Thoughts:** Unsure of the difference between Flex and Grid, but working my way through CSS Grid.

### Day 8: 25 February 2018

**Today's Progress**: jQuery animate() fiddle, wanted to make an animation bar using only CSS and jQuery.
**Thoughts:** Started a
